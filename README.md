> A completely native Discord client for macOS built 100% in
> Swift and SwiftUI

This project aims to create a fully functional native Discord
client in Swift for macOS from scratch. 

## Client Feature Parity

Feature parity with the following Discord client is targeted:

| Version         | `0.0.283`|
| --------------- | -------- |
| Build #         | `115689` |
| Release Channel | `canary` |

## Current State

This project is currently in a *non-functional* state, with
the GUI being completely non-functional. All the magic goes
on in the terminal. Connection with the Discord WebSocket
Gateway is fully functional (but unstable), and the HTTP REST
API is partially implemented (press the button in the header
of the UI to test that out)

## Contributions

Thank you for popping by! If you know the Discord API well, 
have Swift knowledge and feel like contributing, feel free to
make a pull request! Any (positive) contribution is welcome,
no matter how small!
